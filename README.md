WearableComputing
=================

Week 3 project using wearable computing data

The run_analysis file takes 8 files as input: activity_labels.txt, features.txt, train/subject_train.txt, train/y_train.txt, /train/X_train.txt, test/subject_test.txt, test/y_test.txt, and test/X_test.txt.

A merged subset of this data is created as a data frame "data". A summary of this data which computes the mean for each subject, activity, and metrix can be found in the data frame "average".
